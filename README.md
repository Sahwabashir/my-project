 A simple Visual Basic .NET console prompts the user to enter their name, then greets them with the current date and time. It uses the Console.ReadLine() method to get user input, the DateTime.Now property to get the current date and time, and the Console.WriteLine() method to display the greeting.

The string interpolation $"..." is used to format the output, where {name} is replaced by user input, and {currentDate:d} and {currentDate:t} are used to format the date and time, respectively.

Finally, the line Console.Write("Press any key to continue...") prompts the user to press a key to continue, and the line Console.ReadKey(True) waits for the user to press the key before the program exits
